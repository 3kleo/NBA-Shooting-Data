# NBA Shooting Data
This dataset is based on shooting statistics that can be found on [NBA.com](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/shooting/?Season=2020-21&SeasonType=Playoffs&PerMode=Totals). It consists of shots taken by four different players during the 2021 NBA Playoffs.

This analysis was developed using Python. With it, i tried to look at players shooting efficiency overall, when defended by different players and in different zones of the court.

I also flipped the logic and looked at the defensive impact of the players in our dataset.
